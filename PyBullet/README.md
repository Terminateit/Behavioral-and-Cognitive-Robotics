# Task 4: 
## Evolve solution for one locomotion problem with the original (for reinforcement learning) and the modified (for evolutionary algorithms) reward functions.

### Questions: 
> Describe the difference between the two functions. Describe how the behaviour of the evolved robots differ.

The original one is summary of: 
* alive - shows if the robot height above ground and rpy is just pitch (like not 'fallen')
* progress - 
* electricity_cost - 
* joints_at_limit_cost - 
* feet_collision_cost - 

#### 

> Try to explain why the modified reward function are more suitable for evolutionary strategies that the original reward function which has been optimized for reinforcement learning algorithms.
